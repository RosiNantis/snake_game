Notes from Wednesday:
types of bugs:
- Syntax errors: SyntaxError, IndentationError
- Exceptions while executing code: NameError, IndexError, FileNotFoundError
- Semantic/Logic errors (errors that occur while the program runs): the program does something else than we want
Compile errors (C++, Java)
Debugging Techniques:
---------------------
- Code Reviews
- add print statements
- set breakpoints
- use the interactive debugger (ipdb, Spyder, PyCharm)
- comment out chunks of code to isolate the bug
- log information
- catch exceptions to print diagnostic info
- check the git diff
- take a break
Dogma of Programming
--------------------
1. First, make it work
2. Second, make it nice
3. Third, make it fast (but only if it is really really necessary)
